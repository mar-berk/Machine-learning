    "###### Bag of words: \n",
    "The bag of words model is a way of extracting features from text. It is very simple because it ignores semantics, syntax, morphology and pragmatics; however, it is still effective for many languages. This model treats the document as a collection of words and measures the presence of known words\n",
    "###### Naive Bayes:\n",
    "The naive bayes model is based on bayes theorem. Bayes theorem describes conditional probability; the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Naive Bayes assumes that everything is independent. So the probabilities of two words being in a text are independent (even if this is not necessarily the case).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### How they work together:\n",
    "Bayes theorem can be used to calculate the probability that a text belongs to a certain category- bag of words plays a role because the frequency of each word determines this probability. "
